# devcontainer-playground

## Custom Dockerfile Build

This branch introduces a **custom Dockerfile** for building the Devcontainer.  
The goal is to learn how to define and use your own Dockerfile instead of relying on a predefined image.

### Configuration

- The Devcontainer is named `playground-dockerfile`.
- It uses a local `Dockerfile` to build the container instead of pulling an image directly.
